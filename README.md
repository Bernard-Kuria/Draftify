🖋️ Draftify

Write. Create. Build your story block by block.

🪶 Overview

Draftify is a minimal, modular block editor built for creators and developers who love control.
It lets you compose beautiful pages using flexible content blocks — headings, paragraphs, images, quotes, tables, lists, and even code — all rendered in real-time as you write.

Think of it as your creative sandbox where structure meets freedom.

✨ Key Features

🧩 Dynamic Blocks — Add and edit text, images, tables, quotes, code, and more.

⚡ Instant Output Preview — See your content render live as you build.

🎞️ Drag & Drop Media Uploads — Drop files directly into the editor.

🪄 Table Editor Support — Create tables inline with editable headers and cells.

💾 Reactive State — Updates content in real-time across editor and output.

🎨 Clean, Customizable UI — Built with TailwindCSS for a modern minimal look.

🔧 Extensible Architecture — Add new block types or behaviors easily.
